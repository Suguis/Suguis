I'm an Informatics Engineering student at the University of Vigo.

My GitHub repos are mainly non-serious projects, projects for learning myself or personal projects.

- 🔭 My current interests are programming languages, type theory, proof assistants and functional programming.
- 📘 I'm currently reading [Types and Programming Languages](https://www.cis.upenn.edu/~bcpierce/tapl/) to learn about PLT and Type Theory.
- ⭐ Haskell is my favorite PL.

I'm a CS student.

My GitHub repos are mainly non-serious projects, projects for learning myself or personal projects.

- ðŸ”­ My current interests are Type Theory, Programming Languages Theory and Implementation, Proof Assistants and Functional Programming. Also curious about HoTT, Category Theory, formalization of Mathematics and Theoretical CS.
